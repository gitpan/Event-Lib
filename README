Event-Lib version 0.09
======================

This module is a Perl wrapper around libevent(3) as available from
<http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/>.  It allows to execute a function
whenever a given event on a filehandle happens, a timeout occurs or a signal is
received.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In case you have several libevents installed and you'd like to use
the one in /usr/local/(lib|include):

   perl Makefile.PL INC=-I/usr/local/include LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -levent"
   make
   make test
   make install
    
DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    + libevent(3) from <http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/>;
      I lost track of which version is needed, 
      everything >= 0.9 might work
    + a C compiler
