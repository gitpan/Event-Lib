Revision history for Perl extension Event::Lib.

0.99_10 Sun Dec 11 18:53:46 CET 2005

    **** THIS RELEASE IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE ****
    ****  TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS SO READ THE PODS   ****

    Interface-changes:
    ------------------
    - event_dispatch() is gone forever: Its job is now done by three separate
      functions event_mainloop, event_one_loop, event_one_nbloop. Chose the one
      most appropriate. Those are no longer instance methods either.
    - new interface for exception handlers
    - it's no longer OK to enter the event loop (previously with
      event_dispatch) more than once. A warning will be raised in such a case
      and it will be turned into a no-op.
    - explicit use of free()/event_free() will raise a warning.
    - event_log_level() allows to specify which libevent log-messages to
      display

    Internal changes:
    -----------------
    - the garbage-collecting has been radically re-done: event_free() is now
      _strongly_ deprecated. Events are instead freed when they are no longer
      needed.
    - libevent's event_set is no longer called from 
      (event|timer|signal)_new but from event_add() which most notably fixes
      many ref-count and clean-up issues but is also slightly more efficient.
    - many spurious items were removed form the list of exported symbols.

    Other:
    ------
    - tiny fixes for Makefile.PL: -DHAVE_CONFIG_H is now passed and
      'perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS=-static' is possible
      (thanks to <harm AT tty DOT nl> and one anonymous RT-requestor)
    - many additions to the test-suite
    - countless additions to the PODs
    
    All of the above has been done with the help and imperturbable patience of
    Stas Bekman <stas AT stason DOT org> and the other chaps from MailChannels
    (http://mailchannels.com)
     
0.10  Thu Nov 10 07:49:00 CET 2005
    - event_free() was advertised in the docs although
      it didn't exist; now it does.
      (spotted by Carlos Guzman <cguzman AT andestel DOT com>
    - the prototype for event_new() prevented it to take
      code-refs stored in a variable; the prototype is now gone
      (patch by Stas Bekman <stas AT stason DOT org>
    - a misspelling and some bad advice in the PODs of the
      module rectified
      (again thanks to Stas Bekman)
    - only load Carp.pm on demand

0.09  Tue Sep 27 08:01:52 CEST 2005
    - fixed another memory leak showing up in the fh() method
      (spotted by Thomas Yandell <tom AT vipercode DOT com>)
    - make sure that Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage are
      installed in the required minimum versions
      (thanks to Ricardo Signes <rjbs AT cpan DOT org>)

0.08  Wed Jul  6 10:10:18 CEST 2005
    - additional arguments passed to the event-callbacks
      weren't freed due to a spurious reference count 
      incrementation 
      (spotted by Thomas Yandell <tom AT vipercode DOT com>)

0.07  Sun Jun  5 11:05:57 CEST 2005
    - tweaked Makefile.PL so that the capabilities of the installed
      libevent are checked first: features that would require
      a more recent version can thus be disabled at compile-time
    - crudely included a test for priority_init()

0.06  Fri May 27 09:33:22 CEST 2005
    - some of the prototypes were apparently wrong:
      the code given in the SYNOPSIS of the PODs can now be run again
      (spotted by Simon Dassow <janus AT area319 DOT de>)
    - the debug noise on stderr introduced with libevent-1.0c 
      has been quietened. Only messages with _EVENT_LOG_ERR are
      now displayed.

0.05  Mon Apr  4 09:51:42 CEST 2005
    - Event::Lib now in par with libevent-1.0c 
      (might still compile on 1.0, though)
    - support for event priorities added
    - POD- and POD-coverage-tests

0.04  Tue Aug 31 17:48:55 CEST 2004
    - a hairy bug when spawning children:
      no events could be scheduled in child processes
      when kqueue(2) was used. This is now fixed by providing
      the event_init() function to be called in child procs.
    - Makefile.PL fixes for Darwin/FreeBSD
      (both spotted and patched by Rocco Caputo <rcaputo AT pobox DOT com>)
	
0.03  Fri Aug 27 16:13:11 CEST 2004
    - Makefile.PL should honor @ARGV
    - some Win32 fixes for Lib.xs
      (both patches via rt.cpan.org; there was no name attached to them)

0.02  Fri Aug 27 08:22:38 CEST 2004
    - the event callbacks were called without the event-type
      argument. Now they receive this additional arg.

0.01  Sat Aug 14 07:30:14 2004
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
	    -O -b 5.6.0 -n Event::Lib /usr/local/include/event.h
