Revision history for Perl extension Event::Lib.

0.07  Sun Jun  5 11:05:57 CEST 2005
    - tweaked Makefile.PL so that the capabilities of the installed
      libevent are checked first: features that would require
      a more recent version can thus be disabled at compile-time
    - crudely included a test for priority_init()

0.06  Fri May 27 09:33:22 CEST 2005
    - some of the prototypes were apparently wrong:
      the code given in the SYNOPSIS of the PODs can now be run again
      (spotted by Simon Dassow <janus AT area319 DOT de>
    - the debug noise on stderr introduced with libevent-1.0c 
      has been quietened. Only messages with _EVENT_LOG_ERR are
      now displayed.

0.05  Mon Apr  4 09:51:42 CEST 2005
    - Event::Lib now in par with libevent-1.0c 
      (might still compile on 1.0, though)
    - support for event priorities added
    - POD- and POD-coverage-tests

0.04  Tue Aug 31 17:48:55 CEST 2004
    - a hairy bug when spawning children:
      no events could be scheduled in child processes
      when kqueue(2) was used. This is now fixed by providing
      the event_init() function to be called in child procs.
    - Makefile.PL fixes for Darwin/FreeBSD
      (both spotted and patched by Rocco Caputo <rcaputo AT pobox DOT com>)
	
0.03  Fri Aug 27 16:13:11 CEST 2004
    - Makefile.PL should honor @ARGV
    - some Win32 fixes for Lib.xs
      (both patches via rt.cpan.org; there was no name attached to them)

0.02  Fri Aug 27 08:22:38 CEST 2004
    - the event callbacks were called without the event-type
      argument. Now they receive this additional arg.

0.01  Sat Aug 14 07:30:14 2004
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
	    -O -b 5.6.0 -n Event::Lib /usr/local/include/event.h
